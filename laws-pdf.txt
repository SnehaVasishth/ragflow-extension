Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantlyless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, includingensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 aftertraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of thebest models from the literature.

Numerousefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoderarchitectures [38, 24, 15].\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and outputsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hiddenstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht-1 and the input for position t. This inherentlysequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longersequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achievedsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditionalcomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter.

Doing so requires a stack of O(n /k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,or O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest pathsbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive thanrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexityconsiderably, to O(k n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separableconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,the approach we take in our model.",
